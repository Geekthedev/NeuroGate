 NeuroGate: A Secure Distributed Brain-Machine Simulation Network

NeuroGate is a sophisticated distributed system for neural network simulation, combining high-performance C-based computation with Java-based orchestration.

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### 1. NeuroCore (C Layer)
- **Neuron Simulation**: Implements biologically-inspired neuron models with configurable parameters
- **Synapse Management**: Handles neural connections with various plasticity types
- **Memory Management**: Custom allocator optimized for neuron data structures
- **Transport Layer**: Lightweight protocol for inter-node communication
- **Cryptography**: Custom implementation of hash functions (SHA-256/BLAKE2)
- **JNI Bridge**: Interface for Java integration

### 2. NeuroNet (Java Layer)
- **Node Controller**: Coordinates simulation sessions across distributed nodes
- **Task Scheduler**: Manages simulation tasks and monitoring
- **Network Communication**: Handles node discovery and data exchange
- **Security**: User authentication and access control
- **Persistence**: Stores simulation configurations and results
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for system control
