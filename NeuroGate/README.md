# NeuroGate: A Secure Distributed Brain-Machine Simulation Network

NeuroGate is a sophisticated distributed system for neural network simulation, combining high-performance C-based computation with Java-based orchestration.

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### 1. NeuroCore (C Layer)
- **Neuron Simulation**: Implements biologically-inspired neuron models with configurable parameters
- **Synapse Management**: Handles neural connections with various plasticity types
- **Memory Management**: Custom allocator optimized for neuron data structures
- **Transport Layer**: Lightweight protocol for inter-node communication
- **Cryptography**: Custom implementation of hash functions (SHA-256/BLAKE2)
- **JNI Bridge**: Interface for Java integration

### 2. NeuroNet (Java Layer)
- **Node Controller**: Coordinates simulation sessions across distributed nodes
- **Task Scheduler**: Manages simulation tasks and monitoring
- **Network Communication**: Handles node discovery and data exchange
- **Security**: User authentication and access control
- **Persistence**: Stores simulation configurations and results
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for system control

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - JDK 11 or higher
   - GCC compiler
   - Node.js and npm

2. **Building**
   ```bash
   ```
   This will:
   - Compile the C components into a shared library
   - Build the Java classes
   - Set up the JNI bridge

3. **Running**
   ```bash
   ```

## Usage

The CLI provides commands for:
- Managing simulation nodes
- Creating and controlling simulation sessions
- Monitoring system status
- Collecting and analyzing results

Example commands:
```bash
# Start a new simulation
session create 1000 5000

# Monitor results
result get <session-id>

```

## Configuration

System parameters can be adjusted in:
- `java/src/config/app.properties`: Java-side configuration
- Environment variables for runtime settings
- CLI commands for dynamic adjustments

## Technical Details

### Neuron Model
- Implements Hodgkin-Huxley-inspired dynamics
- Configurable parameters for threshold, rest potential, etc.
- Support for various activation functions

### Network Protocol
- Custom lightweight protocol for node communication
- Built-in error detection and recovery
- Optimized for neural simulation data

### Security Features
- User authentication and authorization
- Secure inter-node communication
- Audit logging and monitoring
